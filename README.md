# React useEffect Hook Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where it runs multiple times even with an empty dependency array. The issue arises from how React handles component updates under specific scenarios, not always immediately obvious.  The solution highlights a technique to rectify this behavior for a consistent and predictable component lifecycle.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook, while generally robust, can exhibit unpredictable behavior under certain conditions.  The example provided shows a simple counter component where the `useEffect` hook, intended to run only once on mount, unexpectedly runs multiple times causing unwanted side effects or performance issues.  This specific issue involves a deeper understanding of component updates triggered by React's internal workings.

## Solution

The solution involves revisiting what triggers component re-rendering and ensuring there are no underlying issues causing these rerenders. Often this is a matter of reviewing the component's state and props to identify potential changes that cause unnecessary re-renders and adjusting the component accordingly.
